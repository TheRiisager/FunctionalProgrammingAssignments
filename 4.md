### Handling polymorphism

Polymorphism in Elm and Haskell can be handled by defining a type that can be one of several things
```haskell
--This data type can have any of the three defined values
data Vector
    = Vector3 Float Float Float
    | Vector2 Float Float

--You can then pass a Vector as an argument, and use cases to handle the different vectors.
```  
### Handling errors  

Errors can be handled with Maybe and cases.  
```haskell
f :: Maybe Int -> Bool
f x =
    case x of
        Just x -> true
        Nothing -> false
```
This way, if we're unsure if the values we will be working on will exist, we can handle cases where they don't.

### Currying

Currying means breaking down functions that take multiple arguments, into a sequence of functions, each taking one argument.  
```haskell
--This function is curried, because it is actually a sequence of functions, where each "step" only takes one argument
f :: a -> (b -> c)

--This function is not curried, because it is a single function that requires multiple arguments
f :: (a, b) -> c
```

### First class citizens

in functional programming languages like Elm or Haskell, functions are treated like ordinary datatypes, along with integers, booleans, etc...  
This means that you can store them as variables, or pass them and return them in other functions.  
In Haskell, it looks something like this:  
```
--Save function in variable
pow2 x = x^2

--Pass function as argument
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
powerList = map pow2 list

--Returning functions, calling this function with only 1 argument will, due to functions being curried, return a function that can take the other argument
add x y = x+y

--Another way this could look is as follows:
mapWithPlusTwo = map (+2)
--This should return a function that can take a list and add two to every entry.

```

### First class citizens

in functional programming languages like Elm or Haskell, functions are treated like ordinary datatypes, along with integers, booleans, etc...  
This means that you can store them as variables, or pass them and return them in other functions.  
In Haskell, it looks something like this:  
```
--Save function in variable
pow2 x = x^2

--Pass function as argument
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
powerList = map pow2 list
```

### Pure functions  

Pure functions are functions, whose application have no effects beside their output, and must not depend on variables other than the arguments passed to them.

## Side effects  

A side effect is when a function modifies something outside of itself.  

usually, side effects are to be avoided in functional programming. But certain actions, such as I/O operations, require side effects.
